- **Load_Balancer**: Component that distributes incoming requests across multiple application instances
- **Service_Mesh**: Infrastructure layer that handles service-to-service communication
- **Blue_Green_Deployment**: Deployment strategy using two identical production environments
- **Circuit_Breaker**: Design pattern that prevents cascading failures in distributed systems
- **Health_Check**: Automated monitoring endpoint that reports service status
- **Secret_Management**: Secure storage and distribution of sensitive configuration data
- **Horizontal_Scaling**: Adding more instances to handle increased load
- **Disaster_Recovery**: Procedures and infrastructure for system recovery after failures

4. WHEN scaling database load, THE Production_Environment SHALL support read replicas for query distribution
5. WHERE disaster recovery is needed, THE Production_Environment SHALL support point-in-time recovery within 15 minutes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated CI/CD pipeline for production deployments, so that releases are consistent and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN triggering deployments, THE Production_Environment SHALL use automated CI/CD pipeline with approval gates
2. WHEN running tests, THE Production_Environment SHALL execute comprehensive test suite before deployment
3. WHEN deploying to production, THE Production_Environment SHALL use Blue_Green_Deployment strategy
4. WHEN deployment fails, THE Production_Environment SHALL automatically rollback to previous stable version
5. WHERE manual approval is required, THE Production_Environment SHALL require two-person authorization for production deployments

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want disaster recovery and backup procedures, so that the system can recover from catastrophic failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria
